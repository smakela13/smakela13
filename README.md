### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Full Stack Web Developer with a publishing industry background.

Iâ€™m detail oriented, great at collaborating with others, have excellent written and verbal communication skills, and am a strategic thinker. From my work as a Publisher, Iâ€™m keenly familiar with deadlines and a fast-paced environment. Learning is something Iâ€™m truly passionate about.

In terms of programming, I'm comfortable with HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, GitHub, Node.js, WordPress, and responsive web design. I am familiar with Python, PHP, and MySQL. My skills are growing every day.

Take a look at my [portfolio](https://smakela13.github.io/smakela-portfolio/). You can also view my GitHub [repositories](https://github.com/smakela13?tab=repositories) for more projects. Feel free to contact me through [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarah-makela-0967b91b8/).
