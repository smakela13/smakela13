### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Front End Developer with a publishing industry background.

Iâ€™m detail oriented, great at collaborating with others, have excellent written and verbal communication skills, and am a strategic thinker. From my work as a Publisher, Iâ€™m keenly familiar with deadlines and a fast-paced environment. Learning is something Iâ€™m truly passionate about.

In terms of programming, I'm comfortable with HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, GitHub, Node.js, WordPress, and responsive web design. I am familiar with Python, PHP, and MySQL. My skills are growing every day.
